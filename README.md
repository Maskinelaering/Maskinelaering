Hi, my name is Anton. I am currently completing my M.Sc. in Astrophysics at the Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen.

In my Master's Thesis, I developed a Siamese Neural Network, a type of machine learning model, to identify optimal matches between observational and simulated images of protoplanetary disksâ€”these are young stars accompanied by a disk of gas and dust. 
The motivation behind this model stemmed from a noted disparity in estimating the mass of these objects within observational and theoretical astrophysics. 
This novel approach not only addresses this discrepancy but also holds promise for enhancing our comprehension of star and planet formation by leveraging the strengths of both observational and theoretical astrophysics.

I am currently looking for at job within data science, preferably with a level of machine learning.
