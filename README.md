Hi, my name is Anton. I have a M.Sc. in Astrophysics at the Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen.

In my Master's Thesis, I developed a Siamese Neural Network - a type of machine learning model - to identify optimal matches between observational and simulated images of protoplanetary systems. These systems are young stars in their early stage of formation, accompanied by a surrounding disk of gas and dust. 
The motivation behind this model stemmed from a noted discrepancy in estimating the mass of these objects within observational and theoretical astrophysics. 
This novel approach not only addresses this discrepancy but also holds promise for enhancing our comprehension of star and planet formation by leveraging the strengths of both observational and theoretical astrophysics. The model is easily scalable and can be tuned to other computer vision problems with a focus on finding similar or dissimilar images.

I am currently looking for at job within data science, preferably with a level of machine learning.
